## Introduction

The list of womens health data for AI research was initiated after the [AI in Women’s Health: Bridging research and patient voices 1-day conference](https://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/blog/ai-in-womens-health-bridging-research-and-patient-voices-i-event-report/) on 5th June 2025, organised by the AI for Women's health supra-interest group. 

For our paper, we aimed to bring together a list of datasets and databases that were easily accessible and advocate for the need to make data open and FAIR to increase accessibility and reuse. This list was not intended to be a comprehensive, but a starting point for others to add to.
